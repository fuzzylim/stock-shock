# Stock Shock

## Overview

I am always curious about risks - I've found staring at them, understanding them a great input to prioritisation.  This morning I wanted to reseach reputational damage impact on share price.

The first thing I did was create this file that you are reading, the second was to create a 2 more files to capture my [steps](method.md) and [learnings](learnings.md).

## The definition of reputational damage

Reputational damage is the realisation of any source of reputation risk facing an organisation or an individual. It can be caused by any number of issues but ultimately its source is a negative shift in perceptions from a stakeholder group linked to their perceptions of the company’s behaviour, performance or communications.

## Example

>TSB’s IT failure
>It will be remembered for all the wrong reasons and has been dubbed one of the worst IT system failures in banking history.
>
>As if TSB’s computer crisis wasn’t bad enough, the bank’s poor handling of the situation made it a major reputation disaster.
>
>When the company rolled out a new IT system, their teams took to social media to toast their own efforts. But over the next few days panicked customers began reporting they were locked out of current accounts, unable to access security details and cut off from their own mortgage details.
>
>Small businesses couldn’t pay staff and families were left without cash. The bank took days to respond with insiders revealing there had been worries about the system from the beginning.
>
>It cost TSB more than £175 million, they received more than 95,000 customer complaints and they lost 12,500 customers in the aftermath of the IT failure. The bank Chief Executive stepped down, but the damage was already done.
>
>TSB really needs to take what its learned from its mistakes and turn this to its advantage heralding change, but also ensuring that it has a much better crisis management plan in place should anything like this occur in the future. A new, improved facility is now in place but a slew of compensation claims are likely to cost TSB millions.
