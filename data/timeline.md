[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/timeline-of-trouble-how-the-tsb-it-meltdown-unfolded)

## Friday 20 April, 4pm
TSB begins a long-planned IT upgrade, transferring the records and accounts of its 5.2 million customers from a system operated by its former owner, Lloyds Banking Group, to one designed by its current owner, the Spanish bank Sabadell. TSB warns customers that some services, such as online banking and money transfers, will not be available until 6pm on Sunday 22 April.

## Sunday 22 April
It becomes apparent that the IT migration has not gone to plan when customers attempt to log in to their accounts after 6pm. People report that accounts are showing incorrect balances, while others can see accounts belonging to other customers.

## Monday 23 April
TSB plays down the “access issues”, saying it is experiencing intermittent problems with its internet banking and mobile app, affecting a limited number of customers. However, customers in increasing numbers make their feelings known on Twitter, complaining that they cannot access their accounts. TSB’s parent company, Sabadell, makes an embarrassing gaffe by publishing a statement on its website saying it has “successfully completed the TSB technology migration”.

## Tuesday 24 April
The botched IT upgrade becomes a full-blown crisis as up to 1.9 million of TSB’s online and mobile customers remain locked out of their accounts. Pester tells customers he is “deeply sorry” for the poor service. The bank encourages people to contact its telephone banking team with any problems but some customers are left on hold for more than an hour. Pester says regulators from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are being briefed on developments.

## Wednesday 25 April

Pester tweets at 3.40am to declare: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running.” He says for the vast majority of customers “everything is running smoothly” – but customers continue to report problems. TSB says no one will be left out of pocket as a result of the IT meltdown.

## Thursday 26 April

TSB customers have difficulty accessing their accounts for a seventh day. Pester admits “we’re on our knees” and announces that he has brought in a team of experts from IBM to fix the problems. The bank says it will waive £10m in overdraft fees and pay extra interest on current accounts as it attempts to prevent a mass exodus of customers. Pester says he has not had time to think about whether he should resign or forgo his bonus over the fiasco.

## Monday 30 April

The chaos enters a second week, with some TSB customers still unable to access accounts or make payments. MPs on the Treasury committee announce that they have called Pester – along with the bank’s chair, Richard Meddings, and a representative from Spanish parent group Sabadell – to give evidence on the IT meltdown.

## Wednesday 2 May

Pester appears at the Treasury committee alongside Meddings and Sabadell’s Miguel Montes. Nicky Morgan, the committee’s chair, accuses Pester of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he says the IT upgrade had mostly run smoothly. Meddings says Pester will give up a £2m bonus associated with the IT migration but he could still receive up to £1.3m in other bonuses for 2018, on top of a further £1.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions.

## Monday 7 May

The IT meltdown enters a third week, with the beleaguered bank saying “progress is being made” amid fears that a full service may not return for months.

## Tuesday 15 May

It emerges that TSB turned down an offer of help from Lloyds Banking Group, its former owner, in the early stages of the IT meltdown. Lloyds contacted TSB on the morning of 23 April but TSB declined the offer, despite the fact its customer information was being transferred from a Lloyds system to one designed by Sabadell.

## Sunday 20 May

Some TSB customers are still unable to make payments or access key accounts almost a month after the botched IT upgrade.

## Wednesday 6 June

Pester receives a stinging rebuke from one of the City’s top regulators. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, accuses Pester of “portraying an optimistic view” of services after the IT meltdown and says the bank failed to be “open and transparent” about the scale of the problems. The FCA – which has the power to fine TSB – is investigating the migration jointly with the Prudential Regulation Authority. Pester will face a second round of question from the Treasury Committee on Wednesday afternoon.
